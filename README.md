# A* Path Finding Algorithm for 2D Grid World
## AIM

To develop a code to find the route from the source to the destination point using A* algorithm for 2D grid world.

## THEORY
A* is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm commonly used in games. A* assigns a weight to each open node equal to the weight of the edge to that node plus the approximate distance between that node and the finish. This approximate distance is found by the heuristic, and represents a minimum possible distance between that node and the end.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Build a 2D grid world with initial state , goal state and obstacles.

### STEP 2:
Mention the Obstacles in the 2D grid World.

### STEP 3:
Define the function for the distance function for the heuristic function and Calculate the straight line difference between the two points.

### Step 4:
Pass all the values to the GirdProblem, and print the solution path.

## OUTPUT:

![image](https://github.com/veerapallijanith/astar2dgrid/blob/main/jan.png)

A* algorithm is a searching algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between an initial and a final point.
It is a handy algorithm that is often used for map traversal to find the shortest path to be taken. A* was initially designed as a graph traversal problem, to help build a robot that can find its own course. It still remains a widely popular algorithm for graph traversal.

## RESULT:
Thus, the algorithm to find the route from the source to the destination point using A* algorithm for 2D grid world.
